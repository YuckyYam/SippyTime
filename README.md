### Description

This project is a map generating software that take user made rooms and randomly arrange them so that a different large map would be randomly generated each time the program is run. There are other scripts that can be used for a third-person game, but the main point of this repo is for the [map generation](https://github.com/YuckyYam/SippyTime/blob/master/MapGeneration.cs) script

### Instructions

1. #### Technologies

    - Unity Technologies Input System 1.0.2
    - ProBuilder 4.5.0	
    - C#

2. #### Setup

   Go to Windows -> Package Manager and install Unity Technologies Input System 1.0.2 and ProBuilder 4.5.0. Afterwards, retrieve [MapGeneration.cs](https://github.com/YuckyYam/SippyTime/blob/master/MapGeneration.cs) and [RoomProperties.cs](https://github.com/YuckyYam/SippyTime/blob/master/RoomProperties.cs) from the GitHub repository. Then, you can load in the assets and start creating.
   The other scripts are useful for other aspects of game making.

### Code Organization

All the files can be found in the main repository. There are no separate folders. Again, the [MapGeneration.cs](https://github.com/YuckyYam/SippyTime/blob/master/MapGeneration.cs) and [RoomProperties.cs](https://github.com/YuckyYam/SippyTime/blob/master/RoomProperties.cs) files are the main scripts meant for generation. Unity recommends to keep the .meta file in version control, but you may not need them.
